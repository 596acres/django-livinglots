# Stewards

When access to a [lot](lots) is acquired by a group, we say that the group is
*stewarding* that lot. This is represented by a **steward project** in the 
system. Depending on the situation, you might more likely call a "steward
project" a "community garden" or something similar, but here we opt for the
former as it is more generic.

Before a steward project is created, a **steward notification** is created when
someone enters the information for the project online from a lot's page.
