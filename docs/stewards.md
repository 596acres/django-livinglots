# Stewards

## What is a steward?

When a [lot](lots) is being used by a group, we say that the group is
*stewarding* that lot. This is represented by a **steward project** in the 
system. Depending on the situation, you might more likely call a "steward
project" a "community garden" or something similar, but here we opt for the
former as it is more generic.

Stewards are two things in the database:

 * **steward notifications** come first, and *only facilitators* see them. They
   merely tell you that someone would like to be recognized as a steward.
 * **steward projects** are made only once a facilitator approves a steward
   notification. These are optionally public.


## How is a steward added?

Before a **steward project** is created, a **steward notification** is created 
when someone enters the information for the project online from a lot's page.

A steward notification is created once someone clicks this button and fills out
the form that follows:

Steward notifications are *moderated*, so they don't show up instantly. The 
facilitator for your Living Lots site will get an email when someone adds 
the steward notification.


## What happens when a steward is added?

Once a **steward notification** is added and approved, it graduates to a fully
recognized **steward project** that is only public if the person adding the
steward notification chose to make it public. An [**organizer**](organize) is 
also created for the group or individual leading the project, and this organizer
is added to the lot. Finally, the lot's [known use](lots/#editing-lots) is 
updated to the proper use according to the steward notification.
