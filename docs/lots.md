# Lots

Living Lots revolves around lots, parcels of land that have been pulled into the
Living Lots system. Once a lot exists it should show up on the map and have its
own page. People can:

 * add content (**notes**, **pictures**, and **files**) to a lot,
 * [**organize**](organize) a lot,
 * [**groundtruth**](groundtruth) a lot (make a correction to the use we have recorded for it),
   and
 * [**steward**](stewards) a lot once they have access to it.
